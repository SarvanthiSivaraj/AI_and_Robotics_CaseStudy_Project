## Phase 2 – World Creation

### Objective

Set up a suitable simulation environment for the bipedal robot to evolve and test its locomotion.

### Tasks Completed

* Selected a base world file from Cyberbotics as the starting point.
* Modified the world to fit project requirements, including adjustments to terrain, obstacles, and environmental elements.
* Ensured the world supports multiple robots and evolutionary simulations.

### Notes

The chosen world provides a realistic environment for the robot’s movement while allowing measurement of fitness criteria such as distance traveled, stability, and interaction with the environment.

### Outcome

A customized simulation world is ready for running evolutionary experiments with the bipedal robots.
