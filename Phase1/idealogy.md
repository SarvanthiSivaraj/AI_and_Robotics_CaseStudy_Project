# Self-Evolving Bipedal Robot Species

## Webots Implementation

---

## Ideology

This project simulates evolutionary learning in bipedal robots, enabling them to learn, adapt, and evolve their walking strategies over generations.

Instead of manually programming a walking gait, the project uses evolutionary algorithms to allow robots to discover optimal movement patterns through trial, error, and selection.

## Phase 1 – Setup and Foundation

**Objective:**
Build the base simulation environment and robot structure needed for the evolution process.

**Tasks:**

* Create a bipedal robot prototype in Webots with legs, joints, sensors, and motors.
* Set up an evolutionary supervisor to manage multiple robots and generations.
* Define fitness criteria such as distance traveled and balance.
* Organize the project structure for modular and scalable development.

## Why Bipedal Robots?

1. Complex locomotion provides a rich fitness landscape for evolution.
2. Balancing challenges create strong selection pressure.
3. Gait evolution allows measurable progress across generations.
4. Human-like movement makes the results intuitive to understand.

## Core Concept

* Each robot is treated as an individual with a genome representing parameters controlling its joints.
* Populations of robots evolve over generations.
* The best performing robots are selected based on fitness.
* Offspring inherit and mutate traits, leading to improved gaits over time.

## Future Phases

* **Phase 2:** Implement evolutionary algorithm (selection, mutation, crossover).
* **Phase 3:** Optimize fitness evaluation and visualization.
* **Phase 4:** Achieve stable walking behavior through evolution.

## Tools and Technologies

* Webots for 3D robot simulation
* Python for controller logic and evolution algorithms
* Evolutionary algorithms for adaptive learning

## Expected Outcome

At the end of Phase 1, the simulation environment will be ready with a working bipedal robot prototype and an evolutionary supervisor to simulate evolution-based locomotion.
