# 🤖 Self-Evolving Bipedal Robot Species

### *Webots Implementation*

---

## 💡 Ideology

The goal of this project is to simulate **evolutionary learning** in bipedal robots — enabling them to *learn, adapt, and evolve* their walking strategies over generations, much like living organisms do in nature.

Instead of manually coding a walking gait, we use **evolutionary algorithms** to let robots **self-discover optimal movement patterns** through trial, error, and selection.

## ⚙️ Phase 1 – Setup and Foundation

### 🎯 Objective

Build the base simulation environment and robot structure required for the evolution process to begin.

### 🧱 Phase 1 Tasks

* Create the **bipedal robot prototype** in Webots (legs, joints, sensors, motors).
* Set up the **evolutionary supervisor** to manage multiple robots and generations.
* Define **fitness criteria** (e.g., distance walked, balance, or energy efficiency).
* Build a **modular project structure** for clean and scalable development.

## 🌍 Why Bipedal Robots?

1. **Complex locomotion** → creates a rich fitness landscape for evolution.
2. **Balancing challenges** → provide strong natural selection pressure.
3. **Gait evolution** → produces visible, measurable progress across generations.
4. **Human-like movement** → results are intuitive and easy to visualize and analyze.

## 🧬 Core Concept

We simulate an **evolutionary process** where:

* Each robot = one **individual** (genome = parameters controlling joints).
* The **population** evolves across generations.
* **Best performers** (robots that walk farthest or stay balanced longest) are selected.
* **Offspring inherit and mutate** traits — leading to gradually improved gaits over time.
