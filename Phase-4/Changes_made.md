## Phase 4 – Evolution Implementation and Robot Integration

### Objective

Integrate evolutionary testing and achieve functional walking behavior with a bipedal robot.

---

### Challenges in Building a Custom Robot

* **Mechanical Issues:** Hinge joints and leg mechanisms were not functioning correctly, making stable movement impossible.
* **Construction Complexity:** Building the robot entirely from scratch was slow and prone to errors.
* **Prototype Limitations:** Few pre-existing bipedal robot prototypes were available for reference.
* **Unavailable Code:** Most previous bipedal robots did not have accessible source code, making adaptation difficult.

**Result:** Due to these challenges, completing a fully functional custom bipedal robot was not feasible within the project timeframe.

### Solution: Using Darwin OP3 Robot

* Adopted an **existing, fully functional robot model** (Darwin OP3) to continue development.
* Allows focus on **controller development** and **evolutionary testing**, rather than mechanical construction.
* The OP3 robot provides a stable platform for implementing walking, backward motion, and turns.

### Current Progress

* Successfully integrated our **custom controller code** with the Darwin OP3.
* Implemented basic movement:

  * Walking **forward** and **backward**
  * Turning **left** and **right**
* Robot is now ready for evolutionary experiments to optimize gait and efficiency.
