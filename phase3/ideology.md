## Phase 3 – World Re-Design and Implementation

### Objective

To refine the simulation world, begin building the bipedal robot from scratch, and start implementing its controller for basic movement testing.

---

### World Re-Design

* Modified the simulation world to better suit the project’s needs.
* Removed unnecessary components and adjusted the environment layout.
* Corrected coordinate and placement issues to ensure stable robot initialization.
* Created a simplified rectangular arena to provide a controlled testing space.
* Ensured the world supports iterative testing during robot development.

---

### Robot and Controller Design

* Started constructing the bipedal robot entirely from scratch in Webots.
* Encountered coordinate alignment issues when using the earlier world, leading to development in a simpler arena.
* Utilized fundamental Webots components such as **HingeJoint**, **Solid**, **Shape**, and **Physics** for mechanical design.
* Approximately 70% of the robot’s structure has been completed.
* Began the initial setup of the controller for movement and stability testing.

### Implementation Progress

* Redesigned world is optimized for ongoing testing and debugging.
* Bipedal robot design is partially complete and functionally stable.
* Controller logic is being developed and integrated.
* The foundation is ready for the next phase, focusing on full robot completion and evolutionary gait testing.

Would you like me to now give you **Phase 4 (Evolution Testing & Fitness Evaluation)** in the same style — so your documentation continues smoothly?
