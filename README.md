# AI_and_Robotics_CaseStudy_Project

## Overview

This project aims to develop and evolve a **bipedal robot** using **evolutionary algorithms** within the **Webots simulation environment**.
The robot learns to walk and balance through an iterative process inspired by natural evolution — involving simulation, selection, mutation, and improvement across generations.

Instead of hardcoding motion, the robot’s gait is discovered and optimized automatically through evolutionary learning.

## Project Phases

### **Phase 1 – Setup and Foundation**

* Defined the core **ideology** and project structure.
* Created a **base bipedal robot prototype** and an **evolutionary supervisor** framework.
* Established **fitness criteria** such as distance traveled and balance.
* Organized the controller and world files for modular development.

---

### **Phase 2 – World Creation**

* Selected a **base world file** from Cyberbotics and customized it to suit project needs.
* Modified terrain, removed unnecessary elements, and adjusted environmental parameters.
* Ensured the world supports **multiple robots and evolutionary simulations**.
* Resulted in a functional and adaptable simulation environment.

---

### **Phase 3 – World Re-Design and Implementation**

* Performed several iterations of **world re-design** for better testing conditions.
* Encountered coordinate alignment issues and created a **simpler rectangular arena** for accurate debugging.
* Started building the **bipedal robot from scratch**, using components like HingeJoint, Solid, and Physics nodes.
* Completed approximately **70% of the robot’s physical model** and began developing the **controller logic**.
* The redesigned world now supports efficient testing and robot placement.

## Current Progress

* Simulation environment refined and stable.
* Bipedal robot model under active development.
* Basic controller logic initialized.
* Preparing for the next phase: **Evolutionary algorithm integration and gait optimization**.
